# US023 - As a GSM, I want to assign a Team to an entry in the Agenda.


## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description
As a Green Space Manager (GSM), I want to have the ability to assign a specific team to an 
entry in the agenda so that the responsibilities for that entry are clearly defined and managed by 
the appropriate team.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

**From the client clarifications:**
> **Question:** Can an Agenda entry have more than one team assigned to it?
>
> **Answer:** No.
>
> **Question:** Can a Team be assigned to multiple entrys?
>
> **Answer:** yes.

**From the specifications document:**

> The GSM should be able to assign a team to an entry in the Agenda.
>
> A message must be sent to all team members informing them about the assignment.
>
> Different email services can send the message, and these services must be defined through a configuration file.

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

* **AC1:** A message must be sent to all team members informing
  them about the assignment.
* **AC2:** Different email services can send the message. These services must be defined through a configuration file to allow the use
  of different platforms (e.g. Gmail, DEIâ€™s email service, etc.).

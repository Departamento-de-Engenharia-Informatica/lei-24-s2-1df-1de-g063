## **System Features**
  ### User Stories:
   - US01 - As a Human Resources Manager (HRM), I want to register
     skills that a collaborator may have.
   - US02 - As an HRM, I want to register a job that a collaborator needs
     to have.
   - US03 - As an HRM, I want to register a collaborator with a job and
     fundamental characteristics.
   - US04 - As an HRM, I want to assign one or more skills to a collaborator.
   - US05 - As an HRM, I want to generate a team proposal automatically.
   - US06 - As a VFM, I wish to register a vehicle including Brand, Model,
     Type, Tare Weight, Gross Weight, Current Km, Register Date, Acquisition Date, and Maintenance/Check-up Frequency (in km).
   - US07 - As a VFM, I wish to register a vehicle’s maintenance.
   - US08 - As a VFM, I want the system to produce a list (report) of
     vehicles needing maintenance.
   - US09 - As a GSM, I want to know the exact costs referring to water
     consumption of specific green space.
   - US10 - As a GSM, I want to know which piece(s) of equipment is/are
     used in each day so that I can understand the users’ preferences.
   - US11 - As a GSM, I want to be able to collect data from the user portal
     about the use of the park, so that I may understand the use of the park
     by different age groups.
   - US12 - As a GSM, I want to import a .csv file containing lines with:
     Water Point X; Water Point Y; Distance;
     into a unique data structure.
   - US13 - As a GSM, I want to apply an algorithm that returns the routes
     to be opened and pipes needed to be laid with a minimum accumulated
     cost, ensuring that all points are adequately supplied.
   - US14 - As a QAM, I want to run tests for inputs of variable size, to
     observe the asymptotic behavior of the execution time of the US13
     algorithm.
   - US15 - Predict the average monthly cost that will be
     paid for water consumption.
   - US16 - Consider the data and results associated with US14. Applying
     polynomial regression, determine the best line that fits the data.

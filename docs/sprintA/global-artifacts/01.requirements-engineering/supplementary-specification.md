# Supplementary Specification (FURPS+)

## Functionality

_Specifies functionalities that:  
&nbsp; &nbsp; (i) are common across several US/UC;  
&nbsp; &nbsp; (ii) are not related to US/UC, namely: Audit, Reporting and Security._

The Managers must be able to store specific data, only the one required for their function, in specific groups (jobs, skills, etc.). 
The Managers must be able to modify the stored information.
The managers must be able to create independent groups of information.

 


## Usability

_Evaluates the user interface. It has several subcategories,
among them: error prevention; interface aesthetics and design; help and
documentation; consistency and standards._

The main user of the program are the Managers. 
The Managers will use it to store and modify data. 
The Managers through out the usage of the program must find confirmation steps to assure the good functionality of the program, they will also find a question in every step offering help in order to make the usage of the program easier. The confirmation steps will appear as "warnings" and the help questions will come before the confirmation (as the user is using).


## Reliability

_Refers to the integrity, compliance and interoperability of the software. The requirements to be considered are: frequency and severity of failure, possibility of recovery, possibility of prediction, accuracy, average time between failures._

In case of failure storing the data the user will be given the option to start over.
All the dates must be in the dd-mm-aaaa format.
For every name stored in the system there can only be 6 names inserted and it cannot contain any digit or special character.
An acceptable system failure will occur in the event of the user forcing the system to store information in a format not supported, what will happen nis that the user will have to repeat the action until itÂ´s in a supported format.

## Performance

_Evaluates the performance requirements of the software, namely: response time, start-up time, recovery time, memory consumption, CPU usage, load capacity and application availability._

## Supportability

_The supportability requirements gathers several characteristics, such as:
testability, adaptability, maintainability, compatibility,
configurability, installability, scalability and more._

### Interface Constraints

_Specifies or constraints the features inherent to the interaction of the
system being developed with other external systems._
